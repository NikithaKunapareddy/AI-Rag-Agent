==============================================================================

DATA PROTECTION & PRIVACY LAWS
===============================

GDPR vs India's DPDP Act (Data Protection and Digital Privacy Act) Comparison:

GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation):
- Applies to EU citizens and businesses processing EU data
- Consent must be explicit, informed, freely given, and easily withdrawable
- Right to erasure (right to be forgotten) - comprehensive data deletion
- Data portability - users can move data between services
- Fines up to 4% of annual global turnover or €20 million (whichever higher)
- Mandatory Data Protection Officers for large organizations
- 72-hour breach notification requirement
- Extraterritorial scope - affects global companies serving EU users
- Lawful basis required: consent, contract, legal obligation, vital interests, public task, legitimate interests

India's DPDP Act 2023:
- Applies to processing personal data within India and offering goods/services to Indians
- Consent must be free, specific, informed, unconditional, and unambiguous
- Right to erasure with exceptions for legal compliance and legitimate purposes
- Data portability limited compared to GDPR
- Penalties up to ₹500 crore (approximately $60 million) for significant violations
- Data Protection Officers required for significant data fiduciaries
- Breach notification to Data Protection Board without specific timeframe
- Applies to Indian citizens' data processed anywhere globally
- Six lawful grounds: consent, legitimate interest, legal obligation, employment, medical emergency, public interest

KEY DIFFERENCES:
1. Scope: GDPR covers broader data types; DPDP focuses on personal data of Indian citizens
2. Enforcement: GDPR has established regulatory framework; DPDP implementation ongoing
3. Fines: GDPR percentage-based; DPDP has fixed maximum amounts
4. Cross-border transfers: GDPR has adequacy decisions; DPDP allows transfers to approved countries
5. Children's data: GDPR sets age at 16 (member states can lower to 13); DPDP protects under-18 data
6. Data localization: GDPR doesn't mandate; DPDP may require certain data to be stored in India
